Playwright Tutorials

✅ Day 1 – Setup & First Run: Installed Java 17+, Maven, and Playwright dependency. 
Created a simple Java class to launch Chromium, open a webpage, and capture a screenshot using the Playwright Java API.
✅ Day 2 – Locators & Actions: Used page.locator(), getByText(), and getByRole() to identify elements. Practiced clicks, typing, hover actions, checkboxes, dropdowns, and keyboard events in Java.
✅ Day 3 – Waits & Assertions: Understood Playwright’s auto-wait features and implemented explicit waits like locator.waitFor(). Added JUnit assertions such as Assertions.assertTrue() and Assertions.assertEquals().
✅ Day 4 – Test Structure & Hooks: Organized tests using JUnit/TestNG with @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, and @AfterEach annotations. Parameterized tests for multi-browser execution.
✅ Day 5 – Debugging & Trace Tools: Leveraged Playwright Inspector, screenshots, video recording, and trace viewer for debugging Java tests.
✅ Day 6 – Advanced Interactions: Handled pop-ups, alerts, frames, file uploads, and multiple tabs/windows using Java event listeners.
✅ Day 7 – Network & API Mocking: Intercepted requests/responses with page.route() and validated APIs using Playwright’s Java networking features.
✅ Day 8 – Page Object Model (POM): Built reusable classes like BasePage, LoginPage, and DashboardPage to create a clean architecture.
✅ Day 9 – Stability & Parallel Execution: Configured retries, timeouts, and parallel test execution via JUnit/TestNG. Ran tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
✅ Day 10 – Reporting & CI/CD: Generated HTML and JUnit XML reports using Maven Surefire. Integrated Playwright tests into GitHub Actions and Jenkins pipelines for continuous testing.
